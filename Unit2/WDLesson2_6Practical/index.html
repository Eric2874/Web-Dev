      <p>Web development is the study of making a website and designing it into an actual working good website using html css and java script and the purposes of all three are.
        The purpose of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is to create and structure web pages by providing a standardized way to organize content like text, images, and links for display on the internet. It acts as the foundational framework for websites, telling web browsers how to interpret and render content, and works with CSS and JavaScript to create functional and interactive web experiences.
        The main purpose of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is to control the presentation and visual styling of web pages, separating it from the content structure (which is handled by HTML). It allows developers to define and apply styles for colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing, creating a more visually appealing and consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes. 
        JavaScript serves as a client-side programming language, JavaScript's most common use is front-end web development, improving the user interface and interactivity for websites. Application developers may also use JavaScript beyond the web, to develop games, mobile applications, and server applications.
